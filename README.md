## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: The backend is built with Node.js, a JavaScript runtime that allows you to run server-side code.

- **Express.js**: An efficient Node.js web application framework used for setting up the server and defining routes.

- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making HTTP requests to fetch Amazon search results.

- **Cheerio**: A library for parsing and manipulating HTML content, used to extract data from the Amazon search results page.

- **CORS**: Middleware used to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, allowing the frontend to make requests to the backend.

- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: The frontend is built with these standard web technologies for creating a user-friendly interface.

**Note**: *Note*: The Amazon data policy notice us that they delimited the number of requests for segurance 
and proteccion. For this maybe the code presents instability e doesn't work every time.

But I made a lots of requests and this works well when the requests are liberated!
